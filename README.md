# Quant-Trading-Stock-Analysis-and-Trading-Project
Found a pair of stocks that is stationary and a pair of stocks that is non-stationary using the ADF test. Plotted Z score of the ratio of close data of these two pairs of stocks and shown lines of mean and mean +/- 2*std. Found the Sharpe ratio of any stock of choice from the chosen four stocks between the time frame of the previous year with a time interval of 1 day. Found the dates when Golden Cross and Death Cross (moving averages 15 day and 50 day) are encountered for the same stock chosen above. The timeframe for the same was taken to be 2 years. Applied trailing stop-losses and implemented Mean Reversal Strategy. Generated entry and exit signals and finally calculated the total profit and the profit percentage and also various other data for the trade executed in the stipulated time frame.
